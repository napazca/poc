## Use Case:
I want to add dynamic context value for logging important variables throughout the flow of code.

## Problem
I can't collect the whole list context value which is already saved.

## Hypotheses?
Let's try with map in context.

## Conclusion
With context we could see every step could be recorded and brought back to upper function.
Note: if we don't init the map context in main function, it won't brought back.
